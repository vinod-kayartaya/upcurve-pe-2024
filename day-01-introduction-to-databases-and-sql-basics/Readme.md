# Introduction to Databases and SQL Basics

## Understanding the role of databases in modern computing

Databases are foundational components of modern computing systems, serving as organized repositories for storing, managing, and retrieving structured data. They play a crucial role in a wide range of applications, from simple personal task management tools to complex enterprise systems and large-scale web applications. Here's an overview of databases and their significance in modern computing:

1. **What is a Database?**: A database is a structured collection of data organized in a way that facilitates efficient storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of information. It typically consists of tables, each containing rows and columns representing entities and attributes, respectively.

2. **Types of Databases**:

   - **Relational Databases**: These databases organize data into tables with predefined relationships between them. They use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and manipulating data. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.
   - **NoSQL Databases**: NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or highly variable data. They provide flexible schemas and horizontal scalability. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.
   - **NewSQL Databases**: These databases combine the scalability of NoSQL systems with the ACID properties of traditional relational databases. Examples include Google Spanner, CockroachDB.

3. **Key Components of Databases**:

   - **Data Model**: Defines the structure of the data and how it is organized within the database.
   - **Query Language**: Allows users to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in the database. SQL is the most common query language for relational databases.
   - **Database Management System (DBMS)**: Software that facilitates the creation, maintenance, and utilization of databases. It provides an interface for users to interact with the database.
   - **Indexes**: Data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations by allowing quick access to specific rows based on indexed columns.
   - **Transactions**: Units of work performed against the database that must maintain the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure data integrity.

4. **Role in Modern Computing**:
   - **Data Storage and Retrieval**: Databases serve as a centralized and efficient way to store and access large volumes of data.
   - **Data Integrity and Security**: Databases implement mechanisms to ensure the consistency, accuracy, and security of stored data, protecting it from unauthorized access and corruption.
   - **Concurrency Control**: Databases manage concurrent access to data by multiple users or applications, ensuring consistency and preventing data anomalies.
   - **Scalability**: Databases provide mechanisms for scaling to handle increasing volumes of data and user requests, both vertically (adding more resources to a single server) and horizontally (distributing data across multiple servers).
   - **Analytics and Business Intelligence**: Databases support complex querying and analysis of data, enabling businesses to gain insights, make data-driven decisions, and derive value from their data assets.

In essence, databases are the backbone of modern computing, enabling efficient data management, ensuring data integrity and security, and facilitating data-driven decision-making across various domains and applications.

## Overview of different types of databases (relational, NoSQL, etc.)

Let's delve deeper into the various types of databases:

1. **Relational Databases**:

   - **Definition**: Relational databases organize data into tables composed of rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents an attribute or field. These databases establish relationships between tables using keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys.
   - **Data Model**: Relational databases follow the relational model and adhere to principles like normalization to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity.
   - **Query Language**: Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to interact with relational databases. SQL allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data, as well as define schema, constraints, and relationships.
   - **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.

2. **NoSQL Databases**:

   - **Definition**: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or highly variable data. They provide flexible schemas and horizontal scalability.
   - **Data Model**: NoSQL databases offer various data models, including document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph-based models. Each model is suited for different types of data and use cases.
   - **Query Language**: NoSQL databases may use query languages specific to their data models, such as MongoDB's query language for document databases or Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for column-family databases.
   - **Examples**: MongoDB (Document), Cassandra (Column-family), Redis (Key-value), Neo4j (Graph).

3. **NewSQL Databases**:

   - **Definition**: NewSQL databases aim to combine the scalability of NoSQL systems with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties of traditional relational databases.
   - **Data Model**: NewSQL databases typically employ relational data models but utilize distributed architectures and innovative techniques to achieve scalability and performance.
   - **Query Language**: They often support SQL or SQL-like languages for querying and manipulating data.
   - **Examples**: Google Spanner, CockroachDB.

4. **Graph Databases**:

   - **Definition**: Graph databases represent data in terms of nodes, edges, and properties, making them well-suited for data with complex relationships and dependencies.
   - **Data Model**: The graph model consists of nodes representing entities, edges representing relationships between entities, and properties attached to nodes and edges to describe them.
   - **Query Language**: Graph databases often have specialized query languages optimized for traversing and querying graph structures.
   - **Examples**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, TigerGraph.

5. **Time-Series Databases**:
   - **Definition**: Time-series databases specialize in storing and retrieving time-stamped data points, such as sensor data, financial market data, and IoT telemetry data.
   - **Data Model**: Time-series databases organize data based on timestamps and optimize for efficient querying and aggregation of time-series data.
   - **Query Language**: They may use SQL or domain-specific query languages tailored for time-series data analysis.
   - **Examples**: InfluxDB, Prometheus, TimescaleDB.

Each type of database has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of database depends on factors such as data structure, scalability requirements, consistency needs, and performance goals. Organizations often employ a combination of database technologies to address diverse use cases within their systems.

## Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, enabling users to perform various operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data, as well as defining schema, constraints, and relationships. SQL is widely adopted and supported by most relational database management systems (RDBMS), making it a fundamental skill for database developers, administrators, and analysts. Here's a detailed introduction to SQL:

1. **History**: SQL was developed in the early 1970s by IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce. Initially known as SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), it was later renamed SQL by ANSI (American National Standards Institute). Since then, SQL has evolved through various standards, with ANSI and ISO releasing SQL standards periodically to ensure compatibility and portability across different database systems.

2. **Key Concepts**:

   - **Relational Model**: SQL operates based on the relational model, which represents data as sets of tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). Each table in a relational database corresponds to an entity or concept, and relationships between tables are established using keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys.
   - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: SQL includes commands for manipulating data in relational databases. Common DML commands include SELECT (querying data), INSERT (adding new records), UPDATE (modifying existing records), and DELETE (removing records).
   - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: SQL also includes commands for defining and modifying the structure of databases and tables. DDL commands are used to create, alter, and drop database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.
   - **Data Control Language (DCL)**: SQL provides commands for managing access to data and controlling user privileges. DCL commands include GRANT (granting privileges) and REVOKE (revoking privileges).

3. **Syntax and Query Structure**:

   - **SELECT Statement**: The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified criteria. It consists of clauses such as FROM (specifying the tables to query), WHERE (filtering rows based on conditions), GROUP BY (grouping rows), HAVING (filtering groups), and ORDER BY (sorting results).
   - **INSERT Statement**: The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table. It specifies the table name and the values to be inserted into each column.
   - **UPDATE Statement**: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing rows in a table. It specifies the table name, the columns to be updated, and the new values.
   - **DELETE Statement**: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table based on specified conditions.
   - **CREATE Statement**: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints. It specifies the object type, name, and attributes.
   - **ALTER Statement**: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of existing database objects. It can be used to add, modify, or drop columns, indexes, or constraints.
   - **DROP Statement**: The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.

4. **Standardization and Variants**:

   - SQL is standardized by organizations like ANSI and ISO to ensure consistency and compatibility across different database systems. However, many database vendors implement their own extensions and variations of SQL, leading to differences in syntax, features, and performance optimizations.
   - Common SQL variants include T-SQL (Microsoft SQL Server), PL/SQL (Oracle Database), and PostgreSQL's dialect of SQL.

5. **Applications**:
   - SQL is used in a wide range of applications and industries for managing and analyzing data. It is essential for tasks such as database administration, software development, business intelligence, data analysis, and reporting.
   - SQL is also used in web development frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel, where it facilitates interactions with backend databases.

SQL is a powerful and versatile language for working with relational databases, offering comprehensive capabilities for data manipulation, schema definition, and access control. Its standardized syntax and widespread adoption make it a crucial skill for anyone working with databases or developing database-driven applications.

## Basic SQL Syntax and Data Types

Let's dive into the basic SQL syntax and data types:

1. **SQL Syntax**:

SQL syntax consists of various elements that allow you to interact with databases. Here are some of the fundamental components:

- **Keywords**: SQL statements are constructed using keywords that represent actions or operations. Common keywords include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, WHERE, FROM, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and so on.

- **Clauses**: SQL statements are typically composed of multiple clauses that specify different aspects of the operation being performed. For example:

  - **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to retrieve from a table.
  - **FROM**: Indicates the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
  - **WHERE**: Filters rows based on specified conditions.
  - **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
  - **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.

- **Expressions**: Expressions are used to perform calculations, manipulate data, and combine values. They can include arithmetic operations, string manipulation functions, date/time functions, and more.

- **Comments**: SQL supports single-line comments (beginning with --) and multi-line comments (enclosed within /\* \*/).

- **Terminator**: SQL statements are terminated with a semicolon (;). While some database systems may allow omitting the semicolon for single statements, it's a good practice to include it for clarity and consistency.

- **Case Sensitivity**: SQL is case-insensitive for keywords and identifiers in most database systems. However, string comparisons may be case-sensitive based on the collation settings.

- **Whitespace**: Whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks) is generally ignored in SQL statements, except within string literals.

2. **SQL Data Types**:

SQL supports various data types to represent different kinds of values that can be stored in database tables. The choice of data type depends on factors such as the nature of the data, storage requirements, and operations to be performed on the data. Common SQL data types include:

- **Numeric Types**: Used to store numeric values such as integers and floating-point numbers.
  - **INTEGER**: Represents whole numbers without decimal places.
  - **FLOAT**: Represents floating-point numbers with decimal places.
  - **DECIMAL/NUMERIC**: Represents fixed-point numbers with decimal places, allowing precise storage of numeric values.
- **Character Types**: Used to store textual data.

  - **CHAR(n)**: Fixed-length character string with a specified length (n).
  - **VARCHAR(n)**: Variable-length character string with a maximum length of n characters.
  - **TEXT**: Variable-length character string with no specified maximum length.

- **Date and Time Types**: Used to store date and/or time values.

  - **DATE**: Represents a date value (year, month, day).
  - **TIME**: Represents a time value (hour, minute, second).
  - **DATETIME/TIMESTAMP**: Represents a combination of date and time values.

- **Boolean Type**: Used to store boolean (true/false) values.

  - **BOOLEAN/BOOL**: Represents boolean values, typically stored as 1 (true) or 0 (false).

- **Binary Types**: Used to store binary data such as images, documents, or serialized objects.

  - **BLOB**: Represents binary large objects for storing large binary data.
  - **BYTEA**: A PostgreSQL-specific type for storing binary data.

- **Other Types**: Additionally, SQL supports various other data types for specialized purposes, such as arrays, JSON, XML, spatial data types (for geographic information), and user-defined types (UDTs).

It's essential to choose appropriate data types to ensure efficient storage, data integrity, and compatibility with application requirements. Additionally, different database systems may have variations or additional data types beyond the ones mentioned above. Always refer to the documentation of your specific database system for detailed information on supported data types and their characteristics.

## Creating Databases and Tables

Let's delve into creating databases and tables using MySQL. MySQL is one of the most popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) and is widely used for web applications, data warehousing, and more. Here's a detailed explanation of how to create databases and tables in MySQL:

1. **Creating a Database**:

   To create a new database in MySQL, you use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement. Here's the syntax:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE database_name;
   ```

   Replace `database_name` with the name you want to give to your database. Here's an example of creating a database named `hrms_db`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hrms_db;
   ```

   If the database is successfully created, MySQL will return a message indicating the operation's success.

   Note: Ensure that you have the necessary privileges (e.g., `CREATE` privilege) to create databases. You may need administrative or root access for this operation.

2. **Selecting a Database**:

   After creating a database, you can switch to it using the `USE` statement. This makes the selected database the current database for subsequent SQL statements.

   ```sql
   USE hrms_db;
   ```

   Replace `hrms_db` with the name of the database you want to use.

3. **Creating Tables**:

   Once you have selected a database, you can create tables within that database using the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Here's the syntax:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE table_name (
       column1 datatype constraints,
       column2 datatype constraints,
       ...
       PRIMARY KEY (one_or_more_columns)
   );
   ```

   - `table_name`: Specifies the name of the table to be created.
   - `column1`, `column2`, etc.: Define the columns of the table, along with their data types and any constraints.
   - `datatype`: Specifies the data type for each column (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, etc.).
   - `constraints`: Optional constraints that define rules or conditions for the data in each column (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `DEFAULT`, etc.).
   - `PRIMARY KEY`: Defines one or more columns as the primary key for the table, ensuring uniqueness and providing a unique identifier for each row.

   Here's an example of creating a simple table named `users` with columns for `id`, `username`, and `email`:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
   );
   ```

   In this example:

   - The `id` column is an integer type, set as the primary key, and marked with `AUTO_INCREMENT`, which automatically assigns a unique value to it for each new row.
   - The `username` column is a variable-length string (`VARCHAR`) with a maximum length of 50 characters and is marked as `NOT NULL`, meaning it must have a value for each row.
   - The `email` column is also a variable-length string (`VARCHAR`) with a maximum length of 100 characters. It is marked as `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`, ensuring that each email address is unique within the table.

   After executing the `CREATE TABLE` statement, MySQL will create the table if the syntax is correct and the operation is successful.

4. **Viewing the Database Schema**:

   You can view the schema (structure) of your database, including tables, columns, and their properties, using the `DESCRIBE` statement or the `SHOW` statement.

   - To describe the structure of a specific table:
     ```sql
     DESCRIBE table_name;
     ```
   - To list all tables in the current database:
     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES;
     ```

   These commands provide insights into the database schema, helping you understand the structure of your data.

Remember to commit any changes made to the database using the `COMMIT` statement if you're working in a transactional context.

That covers the basics of creating databases and tables in MySQL. These operations lay the foundation for building robust and efficient database-driven applications.

## Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Data

Inserting, updating, and deleting data are essential operations in database management, allowing you to add new records, modify existing ones, and remove unwanted data. In this detailed explanation, I'll cover each operation separately, providing syntax examples and explanations, using MySQL as a reference.

### 1. Inserting Data:

Inserting data is done using the `INSERT INTO` statement in SQL. This statement adds new records (rows) into a table. Here's the syntax:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

- `table_name`: The name of the table into which you want to insert data.
- `column1`, `column2`, ...: The names of the columns into which you want to insert data. If you're inserting data into all columns, this part can be omitted.
- `value1`, `value2`, ...: The values to insert into the corresponding columns.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a table named `users` with columns `id`, `username`, and `email`. To insert a new user into this table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email)
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');
```

This SQL statement adds a new user with the username 'john_doe' and email 'john@example.com' into the `users` table.

### 2. Updating Data:

Updating data is done using the `UPDATE` statement in SQL. This statement modifies existing records in a table based on specified conditions. Here's the syntax:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

- `table_name`: The name of the table to update.
- `column1 = value1`, `column2 = value2`, ...: The columns to update and their new values.
- `condition`: Optional. Specifies the condition that must be met for the update to occur. If omitted, all rows in the table will be updated.

**Example:**

Suppose we want to update the email address of the user with the username 'john_doe' to 'john_new@example.com':

```sql
UPDATE users
SET email = 'john_new@example.com'
WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```

This SQL statement updates the email address of the user with the username 'john_doe' to 'john_new@example.com' in the `users` table.

### 3. Deleting Data:

Deleting data is done using the `DELETE FROM` statement in SQL. This statement removes records from a table based on specified conditions. Here's the syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `table_name`: The name of the table from which to delete records.
- `condition`: Optional. Specifies the condition that must be met for the deletion to occur. If omitted, all rows in the table will be deleted.

**Example:**

Suppose we want to delete the user with the username 'john_doe' from the `users` table:

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```

This SQL statement deletes the user with the username 'john_doe' from the `users` table.

### Additional Notes:

- **Batch Insertion**: You can insert multiple rows in a single `INSERT INTO` statement by providing multiple sets of values separated by commas.

- **Safety Considerations**: When updating or deleting data, always use caution and double-check your conditions to avoid unintended consequences. Always make sure you have a backup of your data before performing such operations, especially in production environments.

- **Transactions**: These operations can be part of a transaction, allowing you to ensure data consistency and rollback changes if necessary.

These operations are fundamental to managing data in relational databases, enabling you to maintain and manipulate your data effectively. Always refer to the documentation of your specific database system for detailed information and additional options related to these operations.

## Hard delete v/s soft delete:

The concepts of hard and soft delete refer to different approaches for removing data from a database, particularly in the context of handling data deletion while maintaining data integrity and recoverability. Let's delve into each concept in detail:

### 1. Hard Delete:

Hard delete refers to the permanent removal of data from a database. When data is hard deleted, it is permanently erased from the database, and there is typically no straightforward way to recover it. Hard delete operations irreversibly eliminate data from the database tables.

**Characteristics of Hard Delete:**

- **Permanent Removal**: Data is permanently deleted from the database, and it cannot be easily restored or recovered.
- **Space Reclamation**: When data is hard deleted, the space occupied by the deleted records is reclaimed within the database, potentially improving storage efficiency.

- **Immediate Impact**: Hard delete operations have an immediate effect on the database, as the deleted records are removed from the tables and any associated indexes.

- **Irreversible**: Once data is hard deleted, it is usually not possible to retrieve it through normal means. Recovery may require resorting to database backups or other data recovery mechanisms.

**Example of Hard Delete:**

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 123;
```

In this example, the record with the ID 123 is hard deleted from the `users` table. The record is permanently removed from the database, and it cannot be restored without resorting to backups or other data recovery methods.

### 2. Soft Delete:

Soft delete, also known as logical delete or virtual delete, involves marking records as "deleted" without physically removing them from the database. Instead of deleting the data outright, a special flag or indicator is added to the records to indicate that they are no longer active.

**Characteristics of Soft Delete:**

- **Non-Destructive**: Soft delete operations do not physically remove data from the database. Instead, they update the state of the records to mark them as deleted.

- **Data Preservation**: Soft deleted records remain in the database, preserving the historical data and relationships. This approach can be useful for audit trails, compliance requirements, or historical analysis.

- **Recoverability**: Soft deleted records can be restored easily by reversing the deletion operation, typically by unmarking the records as deleted.

- **Delayed Impact**: Soft delete operations may not immediately affect the database's overall size or performance, as the deleted records are retained in the database.

**Example of Soft Delete:**

In a table named `users`, a new column named `is_deleted` is added to indicate the deletion status. Instead of physically removing a record, the `is_deleted` flag is set to `true` to mark the record as deleted.

```sql
UPDATE users SET is_deleted = true WHERE id = 123;
```

In this example, the record with the ID 123 is soft deleted by setting the `is_deleted` flag to `true`. The record remains in the database, but it is logically considered as deleted.

### Considerations:

- **Data Recovery**: Soft delete provides a safety net for accidental deletions, as deleted data can be easily recovered. However, it's essential to have proper procedures and mechanisms in place for managing soft deleted data.

- **Performance Impact**: Soft delete operations may introduce overhead, especially when querying data, as queries need to account for the deleted records.

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Soft delete operations should consider data privacy and security concerns, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected even after deletion.

- **Retention Policies**: Organizations should establish clear retention policies to govern how long soft deleted data should be retained before permanent deletion or archival.

- **Data Integrity**: Soft delete operations should not compromise data integrity or violate relational constraints. Deleted records should be appropriately handled to maintain referential integrity and consistency.

Both hard and soft delete approaches have their advantages and use cases. The choice between them depends on factors such as data recovery requirements, compliance obligations, performance considerations, and business needs. Organizations often adopt a combination of both approaches to address various data management scenarios effectively.

## ACID properties

ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties are essential characteristics of transactions in database systems, ensuring that database transactions are executed reliably, accurately, and consistently. Let's explore each of the ACID properties in detail, along with examples:

### 1. Atomicity:

Atomicity guarantees that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. This means that either all the operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its initial state, ensuring data integrity.

**Example of Atomicity:**

Consider a banking system where a transfer of funds involves two operations: deducting funds from one account and adding them to another. In an atomic transaction:

- If the deduction operation succeeds but the addition operation fails (e.g., due to a network error), the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring that the funds are neither deducted from one account nor added to the other.
- If both operations succeed, the transaction is committed, and the changes become permanent.

### 2. Consistency:

Consistency ensures that a database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction. It means that transactions must preserve the integrity constraints, business rules, and referential integrity defined within the database. In other words, transactions should bring the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.

**Example of Consistency:**

Suppose we have a database with a constraint that ensures that every order must have a valid customer associated with it. If a transaction attempts to insert an order without specifying a valid customer ID, the database will enforce the constraint and reject the transaction, maintaining consistency.

### 3. Isolation:

Isolation ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently does not result in interference or inconsistency. It ensures that each transaction appears to be executed in isolation from other transactions, even when multiple transactions are running concurrently. Isolation prevents issues such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

**Example of Isolation:**

Consider two transactions: Transaction A and Transaction B, both updating the same row in a database table concurrently. In an isolated transaction environment:

- If Transaction A modifies the row, Transaction B should not be able to read the modified data until Transaction A completes and commits its changes.
- Similarly, if Transaction B modifies the row, Transaction A should not be able to read the modified data until Transaction B completes and commits its changes.

### 4. Durability:

Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, its effects persist even in the event of system failures (such as power outages, crashes, or hardware failures). Once a transaction is successfully committed, its changes are permanently saved to the database and cannot be undone, lost, or rolled back.

**Example of Durability:**

Suppose a transaction transfers funds from one account to another. Once this transaction is committed, the deducted amount from the sender's account and the added amount to the recipient's account are durably persisted in the database. Even if the system crashes after the transaction is committed, the changes will still be preserved in the database when the system recovers.

### Summary:

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that transactions are all-or-nothing operations.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that transactions maintain the database's consistency and integrity constraints.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions operate independently and do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability**: Ensures that committed transactions are persistently saved, even in the event of system failures.

Together, the ACID properties ensure that database transactions are reliable, predictable, and maintain the integrity and consistency of the data, even in the face of concurrent operations and system failures. These properties are fundamental for ensuring the robustness and reliability of database systems in various applications and environments.
