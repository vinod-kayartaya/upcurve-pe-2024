## Introduction to Sorting: Importance, Terminologies (Stable Sorting, Comparison Sorting)

Let's start with an introduction to sorting algorithms, covering their importance and key terminologies like stable sorting and comparison sorting.

### Introduction to Sorting Algorithms:

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending, based on some criteria. It is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science and is used extensively in various applications, including databases, searching algorithms, and data analysis.

#### Importance of Sorting:

1. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Sorted data allows for quicker searching and retrieval operations. Algorithms like binary search work efficiently on sorted data, reducing the time complexity significantly.

2. **Data Presentation**: Sorted data is easier for humans to understand and interpret. It enhances readability and makes patterns more apparent.

3. **Optimization**: Many algorithms and data structures rely on sorted data for efficient operation. For example, priority queues and balanced binary search trees utilize sorting to maintain their properties.

4. **Algorithm Design**: Sorting algorithms serve as building blocks for designing other algorithms. Understanding different sorting techniques helps in developing efficient solutions to various problems.

#### Terminologies:

1. **Stable Sorting**:

   - A sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output.
   - In other words, if two elements have the same key value, the one that appears first in the original sequence should appear first in the sorted sequence.
   - Stability is crucial in certain applications where maintaining the original order of equal elements is necessary.

2. **Comparison Sorting**:
   - Comparison sorting algorithms are those that sort a list of elements by comparing pairs of elements and deciding their relative order based on a comparison function.
   - Most traditional sorting algorithms, like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort, fall into this category.
   - The time complexity of comparison sorting algorithms is often expressed in terms of comparisons and swaps required to sort the input.

Here's a list of stable and comparison-based sorting algorithms:

### Stable Sorting Algorithms:

1. **Merge Sort**:

   - Merge sort is a stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - It divides the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together in sorted order.
   - Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and requires additional space for merging.

2. **Insertion Sort**:

   - Insertion sort is stable and works by repeatedly taking elements from the unsorted part of the array and inserting them into their correct position in the sorted part.
   - It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case but performs well on small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.

3. **Bubble Sort**:
   - Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is not suitable for large datasets due to its inefficiency.

### Comparison Sorting Algorithms (Stable and Unstable):

1. **Quick Sort**:

   - Quick sort is a popular comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach.
   - It partitions the array into two subarrays based on a pivot element, recursively sorts each subarray, and then combines them.
   - Quick sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n) but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case.

2. **Heap Sort**:

   - Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a heap from the input array and repeatedly extracts the maximum (for ascending order) or minimum (for descending order) element from the heap.
   - It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is not affected by the initial order of elements.

3. **Selection Sort**:

   - Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input array into a sorted and an unsorted region.
   - It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
   - Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is not suitable for large datasets.

4. **Shell Sort**:

   - Shell sort is an extension of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.
   - It sorts the elements by repeatedly dividing the array into smaller subarrays and sorting them using insertion sort.
   - Shell sort has a time complexity that depends on the chosen gap sequence but is generally faster than insertion sort.

5. **Tim Sort**:
   - Tim sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.
   - It first divides the array into smaller runs and then sorts the runs using insertion sort.
   - Tim sort is stable and has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average and O(n) in the best case.

These are some of the most common stable and comparison-based sorting algorithms used in practice. Each algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the characteristics of the input data and the specific requirements of the application.

## Bubble Sort: Algorithm, Implementation, Time Complexity

### Bubble Sort:

Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list with each iteration.

#### Algorithm:

1. Start from the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of adjacent elements and repeat step 2.
4. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

#### Implementation in Java:

```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        boolean swapped;

        do {
            swapped = false;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if (arr[i - 1] > arr[i]) {
                    // Swap arr[i-1] and arr[i]
                    int temp = arr[i - 1];
                    arr[i - 1] = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
        } while (swapped);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        System.out.println("Original array: " + arrayToString(arr));
        bubbleSort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + arrayToString(arr));
    }

    private static String arrayToString(int[] arr) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("[");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sb.append(arr[i]);
            if (i < arr.length - 1) {
                sb.append(", ");
            }
        }
        sb.append("]");
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

```

#### Time Complexity:

The worst-case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the array is in reverse order, and each element needs to "bubble" all the way to its correct position. The best-case time complexity is O(n), which occurs when the array is already sorted, but in practice, bubble sort is generally inefficient and not recommended for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity. However, it can be useful for educational purposes or for sorting small datasets where simplicity is preferred over performance.

## Selection Sort: Algorithm, Implementation, Time Complexity

### Selection Sort:

Selection sort is another simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into two parts: the sorted and the unsorted subarray. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted subarray and moves it to the beginning of the unsorted subarray. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

#### Algorithm:

1. Find the minimum element in the unsorted subarray.
2. Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted subarray.
3. Move the subarray boundary one element to the right.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire array is sorted.

#### Implementation in Java:

```java
public class SelectionSort {
    public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int minIndex = i;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                    minIndex = j;
                }
            }
            // Swap arr[i] and arr[minIndex]
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
            arr[minIndex] = temp;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
        System.out.println("Original array: " + arrayToString(arr));
        selectionSort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + arrayToString(arr));
    }

    private static String arrayToString(int[] arr) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("[");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sb.append(arr[i]);
            if (i < arr.length - 1) {
                sb.append(", ");
            }
        }
        sb.append("]");
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

```

#### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm involves two nested loops. In each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates over the remaining unsorted elements to find the minimum element, resulting in n \* (n-1) / 2 comparisons. Despite its simplicity, selection sort is not efficient for large datasets, but it can be useful for sorting small arrays or for educational purposes due to its straightforward implementation.

## Insertion Sort: Algorithm, Implementation, Time Complexity

### Insertion Sort:

Insertion sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the input array, removing one element at a time and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

#### Algorithm:

1. Start with the second element (index 1) and consider it as the key to be inserted into the sorted subarray.
2. Compare the key with the elements to its left in the sorted subarray and move them one position to the right until the correct position for the key is found.
3. Insert the key into its correct position in the sorted subarray.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each subsequent element in the array until the entire array is sorted.

#### Implementation in Java:

```java
public class InsertionSort {
    public static void insertionSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int key = arr[i];
            int j = i - 1;
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                j--;
            }
            arr[j + 1] = key;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
        System.out.println("Original array: " + arrayToString(arr));
        insertionSort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + arrayToString(arr));
    }

    private static String arrayToString(int[] arr) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("[");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sb.append(arr[i]);
            if (i < arr.length - 1) {
                sb.append(", ");
            }
        }
        sb.append("]");
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

```

#### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the array is in reverse order, and each element needs to be compared and shifted to its correct position. However, the average-case and best-case time complexities are O(n^2) and O(n), respectively. Insertion sort performs well on small datasets or nearly sorted arrays, making it suitable for use in situations where the array size is small or when the array is already partially sorted.

## Comparison of sorting algorithms

Comparing sorting algorithms involves considering various factors such as time complexity, space complexity, stability, adaptability, and performance on different types of input data. Let's compare some common sorting algorithms based on these criteria:
