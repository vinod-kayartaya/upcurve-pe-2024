# Steps to create a new react application

1. Make sure you have the latest nodejs installed
   - https://nodejs.org
   - verify the installation by running the following command in a command prompt
     - `node -v`
     - `npm -v`
     - `npx -v`
2. Create a workspace folder where you want to create a new react project
3. Open a command prompt (or terminal)
   - run the command `npx create-react-app reactjs-basics`
   - this will create a folder called `reactjs-basics` and creates package.json file
   - installs the project dependencies
     - react
     - react-dom
     - react-scripts
     - and few others (like testing libraries)
4. open the project folder in VS code and start coding
